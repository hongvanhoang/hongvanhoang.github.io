Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial. 

This line is added on 23 October 2023. I use SSH to push -u, done in the following steps:
- check for existing SSH key
- generate SSH key
- add SSH key to GitHub account
  
git fetch on the local repository doesn't show anything if there isn't any changes.
